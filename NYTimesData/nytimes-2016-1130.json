After being contacted recently by one of Branigan's fans, however, the AP conducted a thorough review and established that she had actually been 52 when she died. School records, newspaper articles written about her in the 1950s and 1960s, and testimonials from childhood friends all indicate she was born in 1952. She is also best described as having grown up in Armonk, not Brewster, as the AP's original obituary said.",
